#TO DO LIST


This project is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in C, designed to help users organize their daily activities and manage their time effectively.
It allows users to:

Add, remove, and modify tasks.

Assign each task to a specific hourly time slot (from 12 AM to 12 PM).

View their complete activity schedule in a clean, organized format.

Interact dynamically through a menu-driven system.

The program currently works entirely in-memory — tasks are stored during program execution.
🔜 Planned Update:
The next version will include a file-handling feature to save and load the To-Do List, allowing users to retain their schedules even after closing the program.
